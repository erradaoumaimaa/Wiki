# What is this?

This repository contains the code created while following along with the [Object Oriented PHP & MVC course](https://www.udemy.com/course/object-oriented-php-mvc/) by [Traversy Media](https://www.traversymedia.com/).

The code isn't exactly the same as what is presented within the course. There are some minor differences, like spacing, curly brackets, style, etc. See below for more details.

This code is for sections 1 - 4. Section 5 - 6 can be found [here](https://github.com/cyrialize/traversy-mvc-app). In sections 5 and 6 you create an application on top of the framework. I wanted to keep the framework separate.

# Why do this course?

Creating your own framework is a great way (in my opinion) to understand the inner workings of frameworks and to become familiar with PHP. 

It also opens you up to the possibilities of _not_ using a framework when working on a project.

# Differences between this code and the course
- I went through this course on Linux instead of Windows, so my setup was different (see the section below on how to set it up for Linux)
- For `config.php` I created a `config.ini` file to load in sensitive things and added `config.ini` to the `.gitignore`

## Minor Differences
Most of these are due to personal preference

- Anytime there were single quotes with strings being appended, I switched them to double quotes and string interpolation 
- Used `[]` instead of `array()`
- Used command line MySQL and MySQL Workbench instead of PHPMyAdmin

# Setting it up on Linux

Since `.htaccess` files are used for routing, you cannot use [PHP's built in server](https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php), e.g. `php -S localhost:8000`. 

Instead, you'll have to set up a virtual host on apache. This will also fix the following errors:
- `Internal Server 500` showing up on the web page
- `AH00124: Request exceeded the limit of 10 internal redirects due to probable configuration error. Use 'LimitInternalRecursion' to increase the limit if necessary. Use 'LogLevel debug' to get a backtrace.` showing up on the error log

You'll also need to change the line 7 in `public/.htaccess` to include a forward slash before `index.php`
- `RewriteRule  ^(.+)$ /index.php?url=$1 [QSA,L]`

The following steps were completed on Ubuntu 20.04: 
- Install PHP for apache: `sudo apt install libapache2-mod-php7.4`
  - If you run into an error that looks like this: 
  ```
  The following packages have unmet dependencies:
  libapache2-mod-php7.4 : Depends: php7.4-common (= 7.4.3-4ubuntu2.4) but 7.4.9-1+ubuntu18.04.1+deb.sury.org+1 is to be installed
  E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
  ```
  - You can fix it with: `sudo apt remove php7.4-common` and attempting to re-install
- Turn on the php mod for apache: `sudo a2enmod php7.4`
- Turn on rewrites for apache: `sudo a2enmod rewrite`
- Open an editor for `etc/apache2/apache2.conf`
- Add the following:
```
Listen 8000
<VirtualHost *:8000>
    DocumentRoot /home/mxjonny/Code/traversymvc/
    <Directory /home/mxjonny/Code/traversymvc/>
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```
- You can replace `8000` with whatever port your prefer for `localhost`
- Replace the path that comes after `DocumentRoot` and `Directory` with the path to your code 
- Run `sudo systemctl stop apache2` to stop apache
- Run `sudo systemctl start apache2` to start apache 
- Run `sudo systemctl restart apache2` to restart apache

# Solving Issues

## `could not find driver` on Lesson 23 'The Database Class - Part 1'
You're probably missing the `mysql` package for PHP. 

Install it for your version of PHP: `sudo apt install php7.4-mysql`.

Then restart apache.

# TODOs
These todos are additional things I've thought about adding to the code once I've completed the course.

I may also split this code out and make my own version of the code.

- [ ] Add doc blocks to all of the functions
- [ ] Add type checking to functions
